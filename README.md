# CUPautomation
This holds the files, python scripts I use to automate manual tasks in CUP library
use studcsv.py file to download the jpg image files from the urls mentioned in the stud.csv file. Which should be saved on the desktop. If the location is changed, make appropriate changes in the code itself. this python script will download the image files from url and save them in stud folder placed on the desktop. 
then use rename.py file to capitalize the file names of the downloaded jpg images.
